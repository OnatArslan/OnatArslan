# Hey there! 👋 I'm a Backend Developer who knows how to keep it clean & scalable.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently working at [Wehkamp.nl](https://www.wehkamp.nl/) as a Backend Developer, building robust systems using **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**.

While backend is my home turf — API design, architecture decisions, and performance tuning — I also enjoy crafting clean UIs with **React** when needed.

I care about:
- Writing readable, maintainable code
- Building systems that scale without drama
- Keeping things simple but powerful

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend:**  
Node.js • Express • TypeScript • JavaScript • REST • Microservices

**Frontend:**  
React • Redux • Tailwind (when needed)  

**DevOps / Tools:**  
Docker • Git • GitHub Actions • PostgreSQL • Redis

## 📌 Current Focus

- Scaling Node.js apps at production level  
- Clean architecture and design patterns  
- Improving frontend fluency with React  
- Becoming the dev people ask for when shit hits the fan
