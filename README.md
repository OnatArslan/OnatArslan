# 👋 Hey, I'm Onat – I architect and build scalable backend systems.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Backend Developer currently working at [Wehkamp.nl](https://www.wehkamp.nl/), where I design and build scalable, maintainable systems using both **Node.js** and **Java/Spring** stacks.

My daily work revolves around:
- Clean API design and domain-driven backend architecture
- Query optimization, database design, and performance tuning
- Server-side security, authentication, and production readiness

Although I specialize in backend systems, I also build **well-structured frontends** using **React** — when architectural consistency and end-to-end ownership are needed.

## 📌 Current Focus

- Scaling backend systems (Java + Node) under production load
- Mastering clean architecture and design patterns
- Writing testable and decoupled code
- Strengthening React skills without compromising backend focus
- Building side projects and documenting everything

## ✨ Current Side Project

> Currently building a **Reddit-style project** with custom backend architecture, token-based auth, and a scalable API-first design using Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and React.

## 📚 Backend Books I'm Studying

Reading through a curated list of 21 backend books covering:
- REST API design
- Clean code and refactoring
- System design and microservices
- DevOps, Docker, and scalable infrastructure  
(Ask me for the list if you're curious — it's gold.)
